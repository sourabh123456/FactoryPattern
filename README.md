**The Factory Pattern in C# is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It's commonly used when the exact type of the object to be created isn't known until runtime or when object creation is complex.**

ðŸ”§ **Key Concepts**
Encapsulation of object creation
Decouples client code from concrete classes.
Promotes code scalability and maintainability

âœ… **Benefits**
1. Loose coupling between client and concrete classes
2. Centralized object creation
3. Easier to introduce new types.


âœ… **Benefits of Using Factory Pattern Here**
1. **Scalability:** Easily add new notification types.
2. **Decoupling:** Client code doesnâ€™t need to know the concrete classes.
3. **Maintainability:** Centralized creation logic.
